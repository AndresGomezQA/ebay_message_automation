# ebay_message_automation
Ebay automation for send automatic message to all buyers
- For the ones with an ebay shop it can be the case that you want to send some message to all your buyers
- In this Python script selenium webdriver is used to so this automatically
- The script iterates throuht all the sells in the las 90 days and sends a message to the buyer in each one
- The message is a simple card in .png format that my daoughter draw in her table
  
**TO BE DONE**
- The login must be done manual as this requires to autetication mechanism that I still do not know how to do automatically
- This one messages to the the sellers in the last 90 days (default time room). A mechanism to do a personalized time room could be created
- My next steps it will be to do something similar but for send invoices in png format as a message to the buyer
- To generate automatically the invoice can be cool

**TAKE INTO ACCOUNT**
- The file location you must define for your particular case(PC)
- I have the german version of ebay, hence some of the XPATHs or CSS_LOCATORS may not work when ussing the ebay in another language (you must addapt)
